Hi everyone,

I am Nick Verhelst, a data scientist/engineer with a passion for smart automation and advanced analytics.

The thing I like about building software is that it is always one big puzzle that you are piecing together. Once the puzzle is completed, you know that you have just made someone's life easier.

When I am not coding you will find me in the mountains doing canyoning, running outside or just rocking on the guitar.
